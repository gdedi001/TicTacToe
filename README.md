# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Project Overview
The nanodegree has covered several ways that I can optimize VR projects, and now is the time to get some practice actually optimizing for mobile platforms. The starter project is a complete game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a friendly AI Robot and the only problem is that the scene is completely un-optimized for mobile VR. My task was to use what I just learned to optimize this project to run at 60 FPS on my phone.

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0
